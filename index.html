  <h2>History of the Site</h2>
  <p>Environment Reports was established in early 2024 as a response to growing concerns over the lack of accessible, research-backed environmental information available to the public. What began as a small community blog has since evolved into a trusted platform used by educators, environmentalists, and students worldwide.</p>
  <p>The site was born out of the realization that many environmental reports and climate studies remain locked behind academic paywalls. John Mullen, with support from environmental networks across Europe and Asia, launched this initiative to break those barriers and promote open-access sustainability reporting for all.</p>
